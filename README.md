# js-car-demo
Little demo in native javascript that I made before my web career started. I put some of my knowledge in C++ 2D game engine programming using a language very tricky to do that stuff. I use a HTML5 caneva to run a little police cars on scrolling background not really finish.

## Install

Put the project at the root au web hosting and target index.php.
